                    I am comfortable working on both the front and back end of a web stack, with a preference for back end Python / Django development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My main focus is on creating web apps with a decoupled back / front end architecture using the likes of React and Django
                    Rest Framework.
                </p>

                    My name is Brendon Delate and I am part software developer, part entrepreneur.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wrote my first line of code when I was 15 and was immediately hooked. Once the bug had bitten, I spent high school coding
                    in Basic, then Pascal and finally Visual Basic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In university I earned a Bachelor of IT (majoring in Software Development), during which time I obtained several distinctions
                    and was placed on the Deans list. While I touched on several languages during that time, my main focus
                    was on Java.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Following university I worked as an IT focused Business Analyst for 8 years as a part of several agile teams. During this
                    time I gained insight into the software development process both from the business as well the developers
                    perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout those years, my goal was always to start a company by leveraging the skills I had gained as a BA along with my
                    passion for programming and the stock market.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 8 years I left my BA career to create
                    <i>Diversify Portfolio</i> which is a subscription based SaaS product allowing customers to analyse their
                    stock portfolios and look for opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    More detail on
                    <i>Diversify Portfolio</i> and the technology behind it can be found
                    <a href="{% url 'core:diversifyportfolio' %}" alt="Diversify Portfolio" class="link">here</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My current focus from a programming perspective is on creating web apps using the likes of Django Rest Framework and React
                    with an interest in the real time web (ie: Sockets, Django Channels).
                </p>
